                <p class="block-text">
                    As human beings, we have compartmentalised our time into calendar years, financial years, quarters
                    and so on. To be fair, these breaks do help us pause and reflect upon our journey while also look
                    forward and wonder where we will be this time next year. Wonder, I say and not plan. Wonder gives
                    you so much scope to imagine what can be! And as Einstein said, "Imagination is more important than
                    knowledge. For knowledge is limited, whereas imagination embraces the entire world, stimulating
                    progress, giving birth to evolution."
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    Imagination allows us to let go of those constraints that limit our potential. Imagination allows us
                    to open up to a world where anything and everything is possible. Imagination allows us to
                    experiment, discover, invent and innovate. At Nil, we believe that intuition and imagination are
                    core to the design process. Without it, we are just dry, uninspired individuals finishing our
                    chores, getting things done that were defined by someone else. With imagination, we are dreamers who
                    envision a more beautiful and a better world for now and those to come. With imagination, we
                    discovered gravity, invented a telephone, created an electric bulb, climbed Everest and even landed
                    on the moon!!! Crazy, impossible ideas which happened. Because at some point, somewhere in this
                    world, somebody, imagined it. No doubt that commitment, effort and collaboration led to refining and
                    implementation of these ideas, but it all started with a seed of imagination.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This is our year of imagination. Imagination that allows us to develop our perspectives, look at new
                    ways to process information, create new prototypes, and learn to improvise. Imagination that fuels
                    design for people, making their lives better. We will invest in imagination for every proposal we
                    write, every presentation we make, every tool we design, every meeting we plan and every framework
                    we apply.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Let that imagination go wild!
