            <p class="lead">
                Our team is a combination of dreamers and practitioners who offer different approaches to look at a
                problem and argue upon the solutions until we get the best-suited results. While we work as a team, we
                strongly believe in individual space and growth. That is why our brainstorming is preceded by what we
                call ‘lonestorming’, where we let individual thoughts take shape without external influence

                    behavioural science in human-centric design to create powerful solutions that build a better
                    tomorrow. He is currently exploring youth’s interaction with their natural and social
                    environment as
                    part of designing a communication strategy around commons. He is an ardent cricket lover,
