                    Central to the process of design is the ability to experiment. To venture into uncharted
                    territories. To explore the new. To step into the unknown. However, experiment is always followed by
                    its entourage - risk. They love each other’s company and are never seen apart. Anyone who
                    experiments knows that they will be dealing with the risk of failure. The risk of falling into a
                    ditch because the path ahead is not lit with street lights. The risk of being tagged as foolish
                    because you took a path that hasn’t seen any milestones. The risk of not being able to hitch a ride
                    because you are an unknown traveller. The risk of letting go of another path that is comfortable,
                    easy and very alluring to your tired feet.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    But it is only when we take risks, when we experiment, are we truly alive. Along the path of
                    experimentation, we will always find ourselves under the scrutiny of nay-sayers, telling us that we
                    need to stop and change directions. But as experiment architects, we know that the act of immersing
                    ourselves into trying something new and it not working, is far more satisfying than not trying at
                    all. The world needs experiment architects like Nil, even more today, because of the tough times we
                    live in, increasingly becoming complex and full of conflicts. As design-doers, we must take the risk
                    to enter into the unknown areas because only with experimentation can we design solutions that are
                    path-breaking, resilient, and cognizant of the multiple contexts we live in today.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The great Italian physicist and member of the Manhattan Project team Enrico Fermi commented
                    similarly, about what can happen when you do an experiment. “There are two possible outcomes: if the
                    result confirms the hypothesis, then you’ve made a measurement. If the result is contrary to the
                    hypothesis, then you’ve made a discovery.” (As quoted in Nuclear Principles in Engineering (2005) by
                    Tatjana Jevremovic, p 397)”

                    So shoot for the moon!
