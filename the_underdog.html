                    Have you watched the Cinderella Man? The movie depicts a once-upon-a-time boxer’s grit, resilience,
                    and eventual comeback during the depression era in America. James J. Braddock, played by Russel
                    Crowe, is that underdog hero whom we worship because he inspires us to take chances even in misery.
                    But there is another character who appeals a little more to us. A hidden underdog - a sort of
                    kingmaker, if you would like to say. Joe Gould was Braddock’s manager and corner man who despite his
                    own penury got Braddock his one-off fight at Madison Square Garden. The rest you must watch in the
                    movie which is more about love, faith, and grit in times of unknown, than pugilism itself.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Now, the hidden underdog, played by the lovely Paul Giamatti, is someone who never takes the centre
                    stage. The hidden underdog is like the production team in a stage play who are rarely seen, yet
                    create magic with their off-stage work. But most importantly, the hidden underdog recognises talent,
                    has unshakable faith, and leaves no stone unturned to make the underdog shine. The hidden underdog
                    is this powerhouse of belief who continues to fight against all odds because she trusts her
                    instincts. A hidden underdog has the ability to look at things in parts and as a whole to be able to
                    stay in the game. A hidden underdog explores all options and even the most unlikely combination of
                    these options, because she believes in possibilities when everyone else wants to know the
                    probabilities. A hidden underdog creates alternate pathways unexplored by others in the past, not
                    because they are not scared of losing but because they are scared of not trying.
                    <br>

                    Design thinkers, or the better versions of them work in a similar manner. They are not always
                    endowed with resources. They make what is available, work. They don’t give up on an idea because its
                    perceived probability of success is low. They work on it because they trust the possibility of its
                    realisation. They are not ashamed of going back to the drawing table when they fail. They are the
                    ones who propose it. They are not fazed by uncertain environments. They instil faith using past
                    experiences in those who are unsure of themselves. Most of all, they are not always on the stage,
                    but you will find them hard at work in the corners.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Celebrate the hidden underdog in you!
