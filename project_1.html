                    <p class="block-text">
                        WFP is implementing an innovative nutrition-led intervention to address short-term hunger and
                        enhance learning levels of students in public schools of Lao-PDR. At a larger level, the
                        programme
                        contributes towards the food security and nutrition of school children and their families. Over
                        the
                        years, the programme has created a positive dent in the dietary diversity of children, their
                        learning environment at school and their community’s ownership of the programme.
                    </p>
                    <h4 class="block-subheading">Our Approach</h4>
                    <p class="block-text">
                        Before stepping into the next phase of the school-lunch programme, WFP wanted to examine the
                        process
                        and outcome of their programme at the community, school and policy level. They partnered with us
                        to
                        understand how they could make the programme more community-centric and enhance the impact on
                        school-children and their families.
                    </p>

                            <figure class="figure">

                    </div>
                    <p class="block-text">
                        Our approach was to first examine the country’s social, economic and cultural context before we
                        deep
                        dived into the nuances of the programme’s processes. Our every observation or suggested change
                        is
                        rooted in the context of the community noting their ethno-linguistic group, their dietary
                        practices,
                        the influence of the naiban (village head) on local practices, the availability of water in the
                        school, and even the distance of their village from the local school.
                    </p>
                    <p class="block-text">
                        Over three immersive field visits, our team covered almost 60 schools across seven regions of
                        the
                        country. Our observations informed us that the key concern of the programme was the irregularity
                        of
                        the provision of school lunch during school days. Our conversations with children, parent,
                        teachers
                        and other members of the community revealed different perspectives of the journey of the
                        school-lunch programme in their school and challenges faced at different stages to do so.
                    </p>
                    <p class="block-text">
                        For instance, the cooks, who came from within the community, were allocated different days of
                        the
                        week to work in the school kitchen. However, often one of them would have personal
                        responsibilities
                        to take care of and would forget to remind other cooks that she would not be available on a
                        particular day. The next day, the school would not have lunch due to the absence of a cook and
                        the
                        children would go back home for food. Similarly, if the storekeeper travelled out of the village
                        without leaving the key with the school head, the raw material for cooking would not be
                        available.
                        Other concerns that we discovered included structural and behavioural issues such as inadequate
                        water supply, little or no variation in the food recipe and wastage of food due to
                        overestimation of
                        the number of children present on a given day.
                    </p>
                    <p class="block-text">
                        Another concern of the programme was the absenteeism in school during post lunch sessions. The
                        school break lasted over an hour that gave children plenty of time to finish lunch and run back
                        to
                        their home which was in the village. Often they would not come back to school in the afternoon
                        session. Since, teachers also went back home for their lunch, there weren’t any planned
                        activities
                        to keep students within school premises during the lunch hour. This affected the attendance
                        during
                        the afternoon session which was a cause of concern for the programme.
                    </p>
                    <p class="block-text">
                        With our observations of the entire process, from storage of raw materials, to cooking process,
                        to
                        food in students’ bowl, we were able to provide design inputs to the strategy for the next phase
                        of
                        the programme. Some of the strategy points included small infrastructural changes that made
                        cooking
                        an easier process, creating interactive activities for children to stay in school during
                        lunch-break
                        than go back home, and creating simple roster templates that inform the community members/groups
                        of
                        their day of cooking.
